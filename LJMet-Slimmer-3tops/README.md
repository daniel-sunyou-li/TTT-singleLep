# [LJMET Slimmer](https://github.com/daniel-sunyou-li/LJMet-Slimmer-1lepUL) for 3 Tops to Single Lepton Analysis
Before running `step1` and `step2`, produce the LJMET ntuples using the [`FWLJMET`](https://github.com/daniel-sunyou-li/TTT-singleLep/tree/main/FWLJMET) repository. `step1` is run on top of the `LJMet` samples and consolidates the various samples into single hadd'd files.  `step2` is run on top of the `step1` samples and adds the MVA variables to the `step1`, which are used in training the DNN discriminators, as contained in [`TTT-singleLep/DNN/`](https://github.com/daniel-sunyou-li/TTT-singleLep/tree/main/DNN), which eventually produces the `step3` that appends the DNN discriminator onto the `step2` files.
