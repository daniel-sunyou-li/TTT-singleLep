# Run II Ultra Legacy Jet Energy Corrections and Resolution Scale Factors
Scale factor `.csv` files are available for the Ultra Legacy (UL) production of 2016, 2016APV, 2017 and 2018 MC samples. The preferred production to use as of _December 2, 2021_ is Summer20 and in the MiniAODv2 ntuple format. The `.csv` files can be found in the respective [JECDatabase](https://github.com/cms-jet/JECDatabase) and [JRDatabase](https://github.com/cms-jet/JRDatabase) Github repositories, along with the [Jet Energy Resolution Twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/JetResolution) which can be referenced for usage of the scale factors.

### _b_-tagging Ultra Legacy Scale Factors
Both `deepCSV` and `DeepJet` are _b_-tagging methods that have associated scale factors. Implementation of the _b_-taggers, as well as calibrating the taggers, can be found on the [BTagCalibration Twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/BTagCalibration) and the recommended scale factor campaigns can be found in the respective Twiki pages for the years:
