# ABCDnn
`ABCDnn` is a data-driven background estimation method that transforms a background Monte Carlo sample variable distribution to resemble that of data for a defined 2D-phase space region. The regions are defined by two discrete control variables (nJ and nB) and the `ABCDnn` method allows for 6 regions to be defined, 5 being control regions used in the training, and 1 signal region which is used for any subsequent analysis.  `ABCDnn` is capable of transforming multiple variables for a given sample, and as an example, for the search for pp to three tops, we would be interested in two variables: the scalar transverse momentum of jets HT and the DNN discriminator in step 3.

The `ABCDnn` method is intended to be run following the production of step3 samples where the DNN discriminator is added to the output `ntuples`.  Because it is only intended for use on ttbar samples, then this step is run exclusively on the ttbar samples and the output ntuples will still be denoted as `step3_ABCDnn` to indicate that there is also the transformed distributions available.

## About Neural Autoregressive Flows

The Neural Autoregressive Flow (NAF) is a two-component process which has an autoregressive conditioner and an invertible transformer combined to transform a source distribution into a target distribution. The autoregressive conditioner outputs parameters for the transformer at each step as a function of the preceding input, and any neural architecture satisfying the autoregressive property can be used as the conditioner. The invertible transformer can be any invertible function and fits the target inverse conditional continuous distribution function.
