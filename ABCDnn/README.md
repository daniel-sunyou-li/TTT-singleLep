# ABCDnn
`ABCDnn` is a data-driven background estimation method that transforms a background Monte Carlo sample variable distribution to resemble that of data for a defined 2D-phase space region. The regions are defined by two discrete control variables ($N_j$ and $N_b$) and the `ABCDnn` method allows for 6 regions to be defined, 5 being control regions used in the training, and 1 signal region which is used for any subsequent analysis.  `ABCDnn` is capable of transforming multiple variables for a given sample, and as an example, for the search for $pp\rightarrow t\bar{t}t$, we would be interested in two variables: the scalar transverse momentum of jets $H_T$ and the DNN discriminator in step 3.

The `ABCDnn` method is intended to be run following the production of step3 samples where the DNN discriminator is added to the output `ntuples`.  Because it is only intended for use on $t\bar{t}$ samples, then this step is run exclusively on the $t\bar{t}$ samples and the output ntuples will still be denoted as `step3_ABCDnn` to indicate that there is also the transformed distributions available.
